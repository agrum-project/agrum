An example is available in the download page. It represents the software managing a landing gear of an UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).  Is it is inspired of the example described in [ftp://www.hte.com/uconline/rtp/handouts/fsmach.pdf](ftp://www.hte.com/uconline/rtp/handouts/fsmach.pdf). The model is available at http://agrum.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/model_example.zip, as an Eclipse Project. It can be easily imported in Eclipse using the command “_Import…_”. The implementation of this state machine is available at http://agrum.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/code_example.zip. The implementation is a partial one. It is limited to the transition functions that will be annotated, and the action function.

A demonstration of the proceeding of this example is available at:http://agrum.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/demonstration_example.swf
