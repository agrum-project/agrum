If Model Based Engineering (MBE) supports engineers from the specification to code generation, we want here to bridge the gap between models and static program analysis.

Today, static analysis tools prove the source code correctness, by using mathematical methods, without executing the program. If these techniques are quite efficient and are used in critical context (for instance: aeronautic, nuclear, etc), there are quite difficult to understand and to use. Our aim is to provide the power of static analysis tools in a transparent way for the user.

Following MBE spirit and using existing Eclipse-based technologies, we propose a plug-in to automatically generate proof properties in ACSL on C program from its UML State Machine based design. Our plug-in takes advantage of Eclipse-based tool as MDT Papyrus editor for the design modelling and Eclipse CDT to manage the C source code.
