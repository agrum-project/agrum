AGrUM can be installed on Eclipse SDK 3.7 and TOPCASED 5.2 or later (http://www.topcased.org) using the update site archive at: http://agrum.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/Agrum_update_site_0.1.0.zip

To install it:
  # Go to the “_Help _” menu in Eclipse, choose “_Install New Software…_”
  # A Popup window opens. You can select your archive file using the “_Add…_” button on the right and select “_Archive…_”.
  # Once the update site is selected, check the AGrUM plug-in in the list and verify that the option “_Contact all update sites during install to find required software _” in the bottom is checked before clicking on the “_Next >_” button.
  # Then you just have to follow the wizard and to accept the license agreement to proceed to the installation.

Note that AGrUM needs MDT Papyrus 0.8.2(http://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) to run. If it is not installed in your Eclipse version, it will be automatically install with AGrUM plug-in.
